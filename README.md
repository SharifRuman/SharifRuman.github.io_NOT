### ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

In this project I built a portfolio website for myself. The website consists of multiple webpages. There are a total of 6 different HTML files. I built the website with the Bootstrap 5 framework. Also used both CSS and SCSS properties to style my website.
