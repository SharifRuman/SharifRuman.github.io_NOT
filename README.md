### ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

As part of this project, I created a portfolio website for myself. The website consists of several webpages. The website contains six HTML files and is built with the Bootstrap 5 framework. My website was styled using both CSS and SCSS properties.
